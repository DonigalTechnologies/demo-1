# Binary Search Example

This project demonstrates a simple binary search to find a product by its price from a predefined list of sorted prices. The user inputs the price they are searching for, and the script returns the index of that price in the list if found.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd binary-search-ecommerce
    ```

2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python binary_search.py
    ```

3. Enter a product price when prompted, for example:
    ```
    Enter the price to search for: 199.99
    ```

4. The script will output the index of the price if found, or notify you if the price is not in the list.

## Example
